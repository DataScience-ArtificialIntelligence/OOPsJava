Data compression and DeCompression

Algo: LZW(Lempel–Ziv–Welch)

Data Set: Economy of diffrent contries


For Data Compression and DeCompression

Code Files: LZW, BinaryIn, BinaryOut, TST


Input File for Compression: Data.csv

Output File for Compression: Compressed.Bin


Input file for DeCompression: Compressed.bin

Output file for DeCompression: DeCompressed.csv

We used LZW method for the compression and decompression which consist binaryin and binaryout to convert the existing into bin file which compressed 50% of the data ie. data excel sheet that we have converted to compressed.bin and again using that compressed file we decompresed and then restored the data from binary
