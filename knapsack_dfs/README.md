## Introduction
This repo presents two distinct Java-based 
systems designed to optimize user experience 
and decision-making in search and inventory 
selection contexts. The Search Autofill 
System assists users by providing word 
suggestions based on a prefix, incorporating 
previous search history to tailor results. 
Meanwhile, the Knapsack Inventory 
System addresses profit maximization under 
budget constraints using a dynamic 
programming approach
